# Game of Blackjack in Javascript

This is an original blackjack code.

Could you beat my IA ? That's the question ! 

**********

## Rules of this blackjack : 

* The goal is to be the closest to 21
* Aces = 1, figures = 10 points and numbers = their facial value
* If the dealer is closer to you than 21, he wins the game ! 
* Play as much as you want
