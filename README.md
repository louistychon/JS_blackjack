Blackjack game in JS

This is an original blackjack code even though design comes from 


Could you beat my IA at blackjack ? That's the question ! 

Rules of this blackjack : 

-> The goal is to be the closest to 21
-> Aces = 1, figures = 10 points and numbers = their facial value
-> If the dealer is closer to you than 21, he wins the game ! 
-> Play as much as you want
